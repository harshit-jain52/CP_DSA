// Eulerian Path: A path that goes exactly once through each edge of the graph
// Eulerian Circuit: Eulerian path that starts and ends at the same vertex

/*
Existence of Eulerian Path in an Undirected Graph:
(i) All vertices should belong to the same connected component
(ii) Either
    (a) Degree of all vertices is even; Each Eulerian path is an Eulerian Circuit.
     Or
    (b) Degree of exactly 2 vertices is odd, others even; odd-degree vertices are starting and ending points, not circuit

Existence of Eulerian Path in a Directed Graph:
(i) All vertices should belong to the same connected component
(ii) Either
    (a) in each node, indegree=outdegree; Each Eulerian Path is an Eulerian Circuit
     Or
    (b) in one node indegree=outdegree+1, in another node outdegree=indegree+1, all other nodes indegree=outdegree; not circuit
